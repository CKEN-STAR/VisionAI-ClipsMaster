00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
John is an ordinary office worker living a nine-to-five life.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This morning, he walked into the office as usual.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Suddenly, his phone rang with an unknown number.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A mysterious voice said: "Your life is about to change."

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
John felt confused but continued working.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the afternoon, he received a mysterious email.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The email contained only an address and one sentence: "8 PM tonight, don't miss it."

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
John hesitated for a long time but finally decided to check it out.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When he arrived at the address, he found it was an abandoned building.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At that moment, the truth was finally revealed.
