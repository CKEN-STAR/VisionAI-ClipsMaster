1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Emma just graduated from college and nervously entered the prestigious company.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
She never expected to meet the legendary CEO Alex on her first day.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Alex looked at her coldly: 'So you're the new intern?'

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Emma nodded nervously: 'Yes, Mr. Alex. I'm Emma.'

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Alex frowned: 'I don't need decorations, only capable people.'

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Emma gritted her teeth: 'I'll prove it to you!'

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Thus began a workplace romance story...

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Three months later, Emma won everyone's recognition with her outstanding performance.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alex began to see this stubborn girl in a new light.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But an unexpected news broke the peace...

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Emma discovered that Alex was her long-lost childhood friend!

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Facing this shocking truth, how should they deal with it?
