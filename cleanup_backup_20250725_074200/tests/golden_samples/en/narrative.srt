1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
In the beginning, there was darkness.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Mankind has always been fascinated by the unknown.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
The journey began centuries ago, when explorers first looked to the stars.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Through triumph and tragedy, we persevered.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Science became our guiding light in an endless void.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Each discovery brought new questions, new mysteries to solve.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
In the face of impossibility, human ingenuity prevailed.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
What once seemed like fantasy slowly became reality.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
And yet, the greatest discoveries still await us.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Beyond our atmosphere, beyond our solar system.
